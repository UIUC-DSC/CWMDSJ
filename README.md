## Introduction

Heart disease is a significant health concern globally, with increasing prevalence and associated mortality rates. According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Our development of a classification prediction model for heart disease can be a game-changer. Such a model can help predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various factors such as age, gender, and medical history. This predictive model can be instrumental in early detection, prevention, and management of heart disease, thereby potentially saving millions of lives each year.
