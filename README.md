## Introduction

Heart disease is a significant health concern globally, with increasing prevalence and associated mortality rates. According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Our development of a classification prediction model for heart disease can be a game-changer. Such a model can help predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various factors such as age, gender, and medical history. This predictive model can be instrumental in early detection, prevention, and management of heart disease, thereby potentially saving millions of lives each year.

## Purpose

**Prevent Future Heart Diesase:**
 By analyzing data from past heart disease cases, we can identify patterns and trends that may have contributed to the disease's onset. This information can be used to develop new preventative measures and procedures that can prevent similar cases in the future.

 **Improving Treatment:**
  Investigating data about heart disease can also help identify issues with current treatment methods or highlight the need for personalized treatment plans. This information can be used to make improvements in these areas to increase the effectiveness of treatments and improve patient outcomes.

**Insurance Purposes:**
Additionally, heart disease data can be used in legal proceedings to determine liability and damages in cases of medical malpractice or insurance claims. This information is important for insurance companies, lawyers, and courts to make informed decisions about who is responsible and what compensation may be owed to the victims.

## Kaggle Dataset

Our data is based off a Kaggle available data set, the Cleveland Clinic Heart Disease Dataset.
